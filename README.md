# GeoSort-List
<br>
A spin on the to-do list application, rearranges itself based on which items in the list are closest to your geographic location. 
<br>
Short-term goals:
<br>
-Figure out how to make it asynchronous
-Add in error-handling
-Add in tests
-Check to see if coding style is correct for Javascript
-Mess around with the navigator object, see if there's a way to pass in masterList to the acceptPos function without having to set it as the default argument in the constructor. 
<br>
Front-End Design:
<br>
-Change the layout of the list items, the buttons.
-Add color.
<br>
Longer-term goals:
<br>
-Export and import lists as json.
-Consider using a framework like Angular?
-Possibly add in a back-end server (NodeJs?) so not everything is done client side?
-Figure out a way to hook it up to a database.
-Test support with different browsers.
-Migrate to mobile as well.
-Add in a map visualization option.
