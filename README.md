# GeoSort-List
<br>
A spin on the to-do list application, rearranges itself based on which items in the list are closest to your geographic location. 
<br>
<b>Short-term goals:</b>
<br>
-Figure out how to make it asynchronous<br>
-Add in error-handling<br>
-Add in tests<br>
-Check to see if coding style is correct for Javascript<br>
-Mess around with the navigator object, see if there's a way to pass in masterList to the acceptPos function without having to set it as the default argument in the constructor.<br>
<b>Front-End Design:</b>
<br>
-Change the layout of the list items, the buttons.<br>
-Some kind of rearrangement animation for the list when it's sorting?<br>
<b>Longer-term goals:</b>
<br>
-Use better searching and sorting algorithms<br>
-Export and import lists as json.<br>
-Consider using a framework like Angular?<br>
-Possibly add in a back-end server (NodeJs?) so not everything is done client side?<br>
-Figure out a way to hook it up to a database.<br>
-Test support with different browsers.<br>
-Migrate to mobile as well.<br>
-Be able to "sort live".<br>
-Add in a map visualization option.<br>
